Series: Using Python with Eoddata.com web service
Summary: Master post for the blog series that holds all the links related to making web service calls to Eoddata.com. Overview of the web service can be found [here](http://ws.eoddata.com/data.asmx). This post shows you how to create a secure credentials file to hold the username and password so you don't have to keep entering it, and will allow for automation later. A quick overview is given below of establishing a session using the `requests` module, and parsing the xml response using `xml.etree.cElementTree`.
